# reactjs to docker to kubernetes (with GitHub pipelines)<br>
## Objectives ~ This is my personal "Capstone Project."<br>
#### JavaScript Fundamentals to fully functional ReactJS pages. <br>
>JavaScript files that cover variables, objects, and other components of the JS language<br>
>Create code examples of JavaScript Foundations: can be found in this repo=> https://github.com/sabean365/javascript<br>
#### Building knowledge of Reactjs<br>
>Using Components with state and returns while inputing props.<br>
>Using jsx<br>
>Using react native library<br>
#### Docker container for ReactJS App<br>
>Docker create and build.<br>
>Docker push and pull from private repo.<br>
#### Terraform files that create virtual machines, nets, and security to run the app on Azure VMs.<br>
>Create Vnet, Subnets, Security Groups, Resource Groups for Azure Resources.<br>
>Use Terraform to create the resources, and then init, validate, plan, apply, and destroy to create assets and remove them from Azure.<br>
#### Kubernetes Manifests to create resources.<br>
>Kube Manifests to create clustser, ip rules, etc.<br>
>Create resources on Azure using Kube Manifests and Kubernetes.<br>
#### GitHub pipelines for CI / CD using Actions.<br>
>Create actions to trigger on push or pull events.<br>
>Create jobs relative to the actions.<br>
>Write or copy the code in yaml.<br>
